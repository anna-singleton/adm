# a module is a single directory containing templates
# src - source directory for templates, relative to the cwd of command
# dest - destination directory for templated files, absolute path.
# hook - optionally define a script to be executed when a change happens in a
#        template. starting with a `!` means the command is executed literally,
#        otherwise a script with that name is executed
